## 📋 TODO - CONTINUE TOMORROW

### Priority 1: Core Functionality Testing
- [ ] Test all upload methods thoroughly
- [ ] Verify project analysis is working
- [ ] Test bug report creation and management
- [ ] Verify file content is being stored and retrieved

### Priority 2: AI Integration
- [ ] Add AI API keys to Vercel environment
- [ ] Test AI code analysis features
- [ ] Verify AI bug detection is working
- [ ] Test AI-powered suggestions

### Priority 3: Phase 4.4 - Enhanced Project Analysis Engine
**Status**: Not Started (8-10 hours estimated)
- [ ] Implement background analysis queue
- [ ] Add smart analysis orchestration
- [ ] Implement progress tracking and cancellation
- [ ] Add parallel analysis optimization

### Priority 4: Production Optimization
- [ ] Add error tracking (Sentry or similar)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on APIs
- [ ] Add caching for better performance
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts

### Priority 5: Final Polish
- [ ] Test all features end-to-end
- [ ] Fix any remaining UI/UX issues
- [ ] Add loading states for better UX
- [ ] Implement proper error handling throughout

## 🐛 Known Issues to Fix
1. **Background processing** - Limited in serverless, needs queue service
2. **File storage** - Currently using memory DB, need persistent storage
3. **Large file uploads** - Need to implement chunking
4. **GitHub private repos** - Need OAuth integration

## 💻 Development Setup for Tomorrow

### From Another Computer:
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Elimiz21/DebugFlow-Complete.git
cd DebugFlow-Complete

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your keys

# Run development server
npm run dev:full  # Runs both frontend and backend

# Or run separately
npm run dev          # Frontend only
npm run socket-server # Backend only
```

### Vercel CLI Setup:
```bash
# Login to Vercel
npx vercel login

# Link to existing project
npx vercel link
# Choose existing project: debug-flow-complete-7lnj

# Deploy updates
npx vercel --prod
```

## 📊 Implementation Progress
- **Overall**: ~95% Complete
- **Phase 4**: 75% (3/4 tasks done)
- **Phase 5**: 100% Complete
- **Phase 6**: 100% Complete  
- **Phase 7**: 100% Complete
